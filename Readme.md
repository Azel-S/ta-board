# Teacher Assistant Bot (TA-Bot)
A useful helper for teachers or assistants. When a student needs information, instead of constantly hammering the faculty, the student can first ask the bot for help by asking questions such as "When is Project 1 due?" If an answer can be found within the syllabus or from a previous inquiry, the bot will display that. Otherwise, an email to the TA will be suggested.

## Action Plan
### Teacher/Assistant
1) Create a courseID and password as a teacher or assistant (This is used to access teacher-view for modifications).
2) Ask a few optional questions and to upload the syllabus as a [yet to be determined type].

### Student
1) The student has to input the courseID to access the student view.
2) Ask question:
   - It is first compared with the optional questions to see if there is a match.
   - Then the syllabus is searched with the key words and the section is given to the student.
   - If the answer is not helpful, an option to the log is given (to be answered by the teacher/assistant later).
